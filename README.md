## üåü Projects:  

### 1. **Community Data Program**  
**Description:**
This dataset consists of housing prices in Ontario, categorized by housing type and area. It provides a comprehensive view of market trends and price variations across different regions. Developed and published an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize community datasets, showcasing trends and actionable insights. This project was recognized and published by [Stats Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/data-science/network/data-decision).  
- **Challenges Solved:**  
  - Cleaned unstructured data and efficiently handled missing values.  
  - Performed feature engineering to enhance data quality and model performance..
  - Developed a machine learning model to predict future rental prices.
  - Built a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard using Looker, which was highly appreciated by clients and instructors.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Excel, Looker  


### Data Visualizations from the Community Data Program

These charts showcase insights derived from rental price analysis:

1. **Distribution of Rental Prices:**  
   The first histogram illustrates the distribution of rental prices across the dataset, highlighting the most common price ranges.

2. **Size vs. Price Correlation:**  
   The scatterplot visualizes the relationship between property size (in square feet) and price, grouped by the number of bedrooms.

3. **Top 10 Most and Least Expensive Regions:**  
   Bar charts highlighting the regions with the highest and lowest average rental prices, giving a clear understanding of regional trends.

### NPRI Project  
A machine learning project designed to predict future substance release values into the air by companies across various regions, based on historical data.

**About the Dataset:**  
The dataset was sourced from the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) and includes the following features:  
- **Substance Name**: Types of substances released into the air.  
- **Sector**: Industry sectors responsible for the release.  
- **Company Names**: Organizations involved in the release.  
- **Region Details**: Provinces and postal codes associated with the releases.  

**Project Highlights:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed extensive datasets with over 500,000 records to ensure efficient model training.  
- Performed feature engineering to build a machine learning model that predicts future substance release values by companies, regions, and substances.  
- Visualized trends and insights for effective decision-making using advanced data analytics tools.
