These charts showcase insights derived from rental price analysis:

1. **Distribution of Rental Prices:**  
   The first histogram illustrates the distribution of rental prices across the dataset, highlighting the most common price ranges.

2. **Size vs. Price Correlation:**  
   The scatterplot visualizes the relationship between property size (in square feet) and price, grouped by the number of bedrooms.

3. **Top 10 Most and Least Expensive Regions:**  
   Bar charts highlighting the regions with the highest and lowest average rental prices, giving a clear understanding of regional trends.
